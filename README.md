# 🐍 100 Days of Python Problems  

Welcome to **100 Days of Python Problems** 🚀  
This repo is my personal journey of solving Python problems **every day for 100 days**.  
The aim is simple: **improve problem-solving skills, master Python concepts topic-by-topic, and stay consistent with coding practice.**  

By the end of this challenge, this repo will become a **complete learning resource** for anyone who wants to master Python step by step.

## 📖 Description  

Each day has its own **folder** (e.g., `day-1`, `day-2`) and inside it are **multiple problem files**.  
Every file is named based on the problem it solves (e.g., `add_two_numbers.py`, `factorial_function.py`).  
This way, the repo stays **organized, clean, and easy to navigate**.
