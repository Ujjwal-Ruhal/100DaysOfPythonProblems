🧠 What is a Module in Python?

👉 A module is simply a Python file (.py) that contains code — functions, classes, or variables — that you can reuse in another Python program.

Think of it like this:

A function lets you reuse a few lines of code.

A module lets you reuse an entire file full of code.

⚙️ Why Use Modules?

Because repeating code across multiple files is a waste of time.
With modules, you can:

Organize large programs into smaller, logical files.

Reuse code in multiple projects.

Keep your main file clean and readable.
